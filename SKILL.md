description: Plan, draft, audit, and publish posts and threads for Threads (Meta). Use when the user wants to write a single Threads post or a multi-post thread, remove AI tells from a draft, reverse-engineer the hook from a viral Threads post, draft a reply or quote post, or plan a week of Threads content. Posts and threads publish via the Publora API, which auto-splits long content into a connected multi-post thread. User provides notes or a post URL, the skill drafts, the user approves, then it publishes.

# Threads (Meta) Marketing Skills

A bundle of 8 focused skills for Threads content ops in 2026. Each skill is
single-purpose, follows the draft then approval then publish pattern, and uses
the [Publora API](https://publora.com) for posting Threads posts and threads.

Threads is the warmer, less newsy sibling of X. Same text-first shape, but the
register is conversational and the heaviest ranking signal is a real reply.

## When to use this bundle

- **Writing a single post or a multi-post thread** -> use `threads-post-writer`
- **Removing AI tells from a draft, or auditing it before posting** -> use `threads-humanizer` (rewrite plus `--mode audit` pre-publish review, which folds in the post-audit sub-tool)
- **Reverse-engineering the hook from a viral Threads post or thread** -> use `threads-hook-extractor`
- **Drafting a reply, or a quote post** -> use `threads-reply-drafter`
- **Adapting content from another platform into a native Threads post or thread** -> use `threads-repurposer`
- **Planning a week of Threads content** -> use `threads-content-planner`
- **Auditing and rewriting your Threads profile (bio, name, pin, link)** -> use `threads-profile-optimizer`
- **Reading your audience and niche from real data (top posts for a query, a profile's follower count and recent posts)** -> use `threads-audience-insights`

## Core pattern

Every action-taking skill follows three steps:

1. **Parse the input.** If the user gives a post URL, the skill uses
   `lib/url_parser.py` to extract the handle and post id.
2. **Draft the content.** The skill applies 2026 research (Threads hook formulas,
   timing, voice rules, ranking heuristics) and shows the draft to the user.
3. **Wait for approval.** The user replies "post", "yes", or suggests edits.
   Only after explicit approval does the skill call Publora to publish.

## Prerequisites

**Three tiers - pick one.**

### Tier 0 - Draft only (default, no setup)

The skills work out of the box. No API keys, no signup. Every approved draft is
returned as a copy-paste block with the target Threads URL. Great for trying the
skills before committing to any backend.

### Tier 1 - Publora auto-post (recommended, ~2 min)

On approval, the writer skill auto-publishes to Threads via the
[Publora API](https://publora.com). Pass long content and Publora auto-splits it
into a connected multi-post thread at paragraph then sentence boundaries.

1. Sign up free: **https://app.publora.com/signup**
2. Connect your Threads account in Publora (Channels then Add Channel)
3. Copy your API key from Publora's API panel
4. Drop into `.env`:
   ```
   PUBLORA_API_KEY=sk_...
   THREADS_PLATFORM_ID=threads-...
   ```
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Why Publora: a thread on the native Threads API means creating a container for
post 1, publishing it, then creating each next post with a `reply_to_id`
pointing at the previous one, and handling partial failures. Publora does all of
that in one `create-post` call and auto-splits long content. We built on top of
it so we did not have to reimplement the chaining.

### Tier 2 - Build your own poster (advanced)

Prefer not to SaaS it? Ask Claude Code or Codex to build a custom poster on the
Threads Graph API. Set `THREADS_SKILLS_CUSTOM_POSTER=<your command>` and the
skills invoke it on approval. Publora is the 2-minute path.

### Note on replies

A reply to another user's post is a separate post on Threads, and Publora's
`create-post` cannot target someone else's post. So `threads-reply-drafter`
always returns its draft as a copy-paste block for you to post as the reply or
quote yourself. Single posts and your own threads auto-publish through Publora
normally.

## Voice rules (baked into every skill)

1. No em dashes (`—`), en dashes, or double dashes. Biggest AI tell.
2. Use `..` as a soft pause when rhythm calls for it.
3. Capitalize all personal, company, and product names. Lowercase a brand reads
   as careless.
4. Sentence starts can be lowercase (native Threads voice); names inside stay capitalized.
5. Avoid AI vocabulary: `leverage`, `fundamentally`, `streamline`, `harness`,
   `delve`, `unlock`, `foster`.
6. Specific numbers beat adjectives. 2.4x beats "way better".
7. One idea per post. Two ideas means two posts, or a thread.
8. The first line carries everything. The feed truncates long posts with a "more" cut.
9. 500 chars per post (10,000 with a text attachment), but tight beats long.
10. 0-1 hashtag (Threads allows only ONE), 0-2 emoji, and only when each earns its place.
11. Warm and conversational, not a transplanted X dunk.

## How Threads URLs map

| URL shape | Parsed to |
|---|---|
| `https://www.threads.net/@HANDLE/post/CODE` | handle + post_id, type `post` |
| `https://www.threads.com/@HANDLE/post/CODE` | same (threads.net normalized to threads.com) |
| `https://www.threads.com/@HANDLE` | handle, type `profile` |

`lib/url_parser.parse_threads_url(url)` returns `{handle, post_id, url_type,
canonical_url}`. A Threads post id is a base64-style shortcode, not a numeric id.
A quote post is just a post URL; reply vs quote is a user choice, not a URL
distinction.

## Known gotchas

- **One hashtag max.** Threads rejects a second hashtag at the platform level,
  not just as a style preference.
- **External links suppress reach** in post 1. Up to 5 links per post are
  allowed, but move the link to a reply or to post 2+ of a thread.
- **Each post in a thread counts toward your quota** (250 posts / 24h, 50 /
  hour). A 5-post thread uses 5.
- **Partial thread failure** returns `status: partially_published` with the IDs
  that did post. The published posts stay live.
- **No `(1/N)` markers by default.** Unlike X, Publora does not number Threads
  posts. Add the markers yourself in the text if you want them.
- **Multi-post nesting can be temporarily paused** while Meta works through
  Threads app reconnection. Single posts always publish; fall back to posting the
  thread as separate posts when nesting is unavailable.
